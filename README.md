An original design for a SmartWatch.

The SmartWatch uses and OLED display and uses an Arduino Uno, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, a motor, and a 9V battery.

It is meant to do two simple tasks: tell time and date, and notify you when a text or call has been received.
The motor vibrates when there is a new text or call.

The SmartWatch has been programmed on the Arduino IDE and is compatible with both the microprocessor and Bluetooth module.
An application for Android has also been developed to send data to the Arduino Uno.

Compatible with Android devices.
