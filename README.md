An original design for a SmartWatch.

The SmartWatch will have an OLED display and use an Adafruit Microprocessor, an Adafruit Bluetooth module, a small motor, two buttons,
and a Lithium Ion battery.

It is meant to do two simple tasks: tell time and date, and notify you when there is a new notification.
The small motor will vibrate when there is a new notifications and the button will display that notification when clicked.

Another button will be an on/off switch.

A case will be designed on TinkerCad and 3D printed so the watch can be worn.

The SmartWatch will be programmed on the Arduino IDE that is compatible with both the microprocessor and Bluetooth module.

Currently working on code.
